Technology and documentation: We rely on modern technology, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to detect manipulation and verify the authenticity of content. Our rules require some sites to implement strict content documentation systems to ensure the credibility of information.

Education and Awareness: We seek to educate the public about the dangers of content manipulation through educational and awareness programs. We support these programs in collaboration with governments and educational institutions.
